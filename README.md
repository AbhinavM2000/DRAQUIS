# DRAQUIS - Distributed Real-time Air Quality Indexing System
A distributed real time data gathering sensor network for Air pollution indexing.

## About
Air pollution is one of the greatest problems nowadays because it can cause numerous health problems, especially in urban areas. Therefore, there is a need to keep track of the local air quality index of a region in real time to study causes and possible remedial measures we can apply to solve the problem.

We are proposing a distributed network of IoT devices with air quality sensors. These portable devices shall be fitted with solar panes for power, and can be deployed along existing infrastructure in a region such as street light poles, traffic signs etc. This way, there is an even distribution of sensors across the target area. The IoT devices will transmit data real-time through WiFi to a web server that will quantify the data into a visual representation such as a map or graph. This data can then be implemented in other use cases such as giving a push notification to residents of an area when air pollution levels spike.

By using such a network of sensors, the root causes of pollution can be dealt with and managed efficiently, at the same time increasing awareness in the society at which the system is being employed.

The individual devices will be all weather proof and will have 2 days of battery even if the solar panel fails, in case of any faults Maintenance messages can be sent back to the web-server to get defective units fixed and prevent faulty data .
